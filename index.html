        <h2>WHAT IS PHOTOSYNTHESIS?</h2>
        <p>THE PROCESS BY WHICH PLANT PREPARE THERE FOOD THAT PROCESS IS CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS</p>
        <h3 class="special-h3">process of photosynthesis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-1"><span>step 1 :-</span> water and minerals present in the soil are absoved by the roots and transport to the leaves with the help vessels.</li>
            <li class="list-2"><span>step 2 :-</span> carbon dioxide from air is taken in through the tiny prosh present in the surface of the leaves ,these prosh are surrounded by "gaurd-cells" such prosh are called stomata. </li>
            <li class="list-3"><span>step 3 :- </span>leaves have a green pigment called chlorophyll. chlorophyll capture the energy of the sunlight.</li>
            <li class="list-4"><span>step 4 :- </span>after that leaves mixed all the things and convert into glucose and transport in all the parts of plant through the vessels.</li>
            <li class="list-5"><span> imporatant NOTE :-</span> IN THE ABSENCE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS LIFE WOULD BE IMPOSSIPLE ON THE EARTH.</li>
